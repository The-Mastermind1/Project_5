# Project_5
THIS PROJECT USES THE FIXED POINT ITERATION METHOD AND THE NEWTONS METHOD IN ORDER TO APPROACH THE SOLUTION OF THIS FUNCTION : F(X)=0.2*(e^X+COS(Î *X))+X-0.4 IN THE INTERVAL [A,B] WITH MAXIMUM NUMBER OF ITERATIONS=12 . THE CODE IS IN THE Header.h AND Source.CPP
F(X)=0.2*(E^X+COS(P*X))+X-0.4
